1. Run `pnpm dev` to run the dev script.
1. Open your browser at <http://localhost:3002>.

## Documentation

### Environment variables

`.env`:

- `PORT` (optional): Port to run the service on.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` (optional): Allow list for CORS, as parseable JSON.
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to the service account credentials file for Firestore.
- `COLLECTION_NAME` (optional): Name of the collection to use in Firestore.
- `JWT_SECRET_PATH`: Path to the file containing the JWT secret.

`.env.development.local` (**secret**):

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` (optional): Admin account username for the `create-admin` script.
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` (optional): Admin account email for the `create-admin` script.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (optional): Admin account password for the `create-admin` script.

### Database client

- The database client is defined in `./src/db/clients.ts`. It connects to Google Cloud Datastore (Firestore).
- Connecting to Firestore requires service account credentials file. The path to the file must be set in the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- The client looks for the `COLLECTION_NAME` environment variable to determine the collection name to use in Firestore.

    |-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
    | 201 (Created)               | User created successfully, created user data returned |
    | 400 (Bad Request)           | Missing fields                                        |

#### Get User

- This endpoint allows retrieval of a single user's data from the database using the user's ID. Note that password hash is not returned.

- HTTP Method: `GET`

- Endpoint: http://localhost:3002/users/{userId}

- Parameters
    - Required: `userId` path parameter
    - Example: `http://localhost:3002/users/60c72b2f9b1d4c3a2e5f8b4c`

- <a name="auth-header">Headers</a>

    - Required: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN>`

    - Explanation: This endpoint requires the client to include a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the HTTP request header for authentication and authorization. This token is generated during the authentication process (i.e., login) and contains information about the user's identity. The server verifies this token to ensure that the client is authorized to access the data.

    - Auth Rules:

        - Admin users: Can retrieve any user's data. The server verifies the user associated with the JWT token is an admin user and allows access to the requested user's data.

        - Non-admin users: Can only retrieve their own data. The server checks if the user ID in the request URL matches the ID of the user associated with the JWT token. If it matches, the server returns the user's own data.

    | 404 (Not Found)             | User with the specified ID not found                     |
