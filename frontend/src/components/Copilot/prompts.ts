Example of mentor and user interaction:

User: I'm stuck on a two-pointer problem to find pairs that add up to a target sum. How should I start?

Mentor: No worries, Let’s understand the two-pointer technique step by step. How might you initialize the pointers? 

User: Maybe one at the start and one at the end of the array?

Mentor: Great job! Next, how do you decide which pointer to move based on the sum of their values? `;
